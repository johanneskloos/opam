Interface to EventRacer.

The EventRacer project provides instrumented browsers that output event
traces of their operation. These traces are extremely useful for building
dynamic analyses of JavaScript and web pages; for instance, EventRacer
itself provides a race detection tool.

The file format used by EventRacer is a custom binary format (the action log),
for which they provide a C++ API. This project wraps the C++ API to provide
an OCaml API for these files. Additionally, we also wrap the race analysis
itself.
